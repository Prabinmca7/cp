    date: 12/01/2014
    description: Updated sorting order to be consistent across widget
    details:
    - The widget had previously designated descending as A-Z and ascending as Z-A.  This
      was incorrect ordering, so the widget now correctly designates descending as
      Z-A and ascending as A-Z.  This change affects the sorting order, the screen
      reader text, and the sorting arrow.

    changelogID: 239
    date: 02/11/2014
    description: Table headers now include a sort direction header for accessibility
    details:
    - Prior to this change, the table headers gave no indication to screen readers
      of their sort direction. After this change, the direction is indicated through
      a sort ascending or sort descending label in the table header.
    - It is unlikely that this change will impact an upgraded site, but some customizations
      of the Grid widget which depend on the table header content will need to be
      adjusted to skip the screen reader text.

    date: 01/22/2014
    description: Changed report so that zero values do not display as a space
    details:
    - Previously, if the value of any column was 0, the Grid report rendered the value
      as a blank space instead of 0. Now the report will render a 0 for columns with
      a value of 0.
