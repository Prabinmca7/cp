    description: Multiline no longer attempts to focus on the first link displayed
      when reports change
    details:
    - Multiline no longer attempts to focus on the first link displayed when reports
      change.  This functionality now applies to any widgets that extend Multiline.  This
      change was made because the element that makes the most sense to initially focus
      on is different for each widget.
