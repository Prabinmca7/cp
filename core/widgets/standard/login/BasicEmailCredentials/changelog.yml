    description: Renamed emailCredentials controller function to sendEmailCredentials
    details:
    - In order to not conflict with the EmailCredentials widget's class name, the
      function emailCredentials was renamed to sendEmailCredentials. The BasicEmailCredentials
      widget is impacted because it inherits this function.
