    description: Widget will no longer display when the CP\_CONTACT\_LOGIN\_REQUIRED
      config setting is enabled
    details:
    - When the CP\_CONTACT\_LOGIN\_REQUIRED config is enabled, the RSS endpoint will
      not provide results and will return a 403, so to avoid advertising the RSS endpoint
      to browsers, this widget will no longer render when that config is enabled.
