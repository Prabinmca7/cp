    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Parent window is not used if SmartAssistantDialog is defined in the
      parent window
    details:
    - If a guide is accessed via SmartAssistant results, then the user will be in
      the middle of submitting a question.  This change will prevent an answer that
      appears in a guide from causing the incident submission page from redirecting
      to the answer detail page, which would cause the user to lose their incident
      details and SmartAssistant results.

    description: Fixes Guided Assistant statistics tracking when using link type questions
    details:
    - When using a link type question as the second or later question in a guide in
      Internet Explorer, the statistics for Guided Assistant Effectiveness incorrectly
      report two guide views when in fact the guide had only been viewed once. The
      statistics are now correctly recorded.
