    description: Fixed a defect where topic browse results where not getting updated
      on subsequent searches.
    details:
    - After a successful search was performed and matching topics were displayed,
      a subsequent search would not update the topic browse results.
    - Results are now updated, either to reflect new matches, or to reflect the lack
      of search results in which case the default topics are displayed minus any 'matches'.

    description: Maintains TopicBrowse filters when used with the Paginator widget
    details:
    - Previously, when users clicked a topic on the TopicBrowse widget and the topic
      returned more results than could be displayed on a single page, selecting a
      page link on the Paginator widget removed the topic filter and displayed all
      answers instead. The filter now persists across multiple pages.
