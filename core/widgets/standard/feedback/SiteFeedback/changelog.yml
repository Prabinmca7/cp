    description: Handle feedback responses correctly to ensure errors are not ignored
      and the expected response is returned
    details:
    - Fixed a defect where errors sent back from the server after submitting feedback
      were being ignored.
    - The server response when submitting feedback was previously an integer upon
      success and an error string upon error.
    - The response is now an object with an 'error' key upon error, and 'ID' upon
      success.
