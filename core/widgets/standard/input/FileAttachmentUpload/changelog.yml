    description: Minor Bump in CP attachment widgets for honouring the valid\_file\_extensions
      config verb
    details:
    - The CP file attachment widgets were enhanced to honor the file extensions configured
      in the "VALID\_FILE\_EXTENSIONS" configuration setting. All allowed file extensions
      configured in the siteConfig JSON file must be copied into the "VALID\_FILE\_EXTENSIONS"
      configuration setting. The siteConfig JSON file allowed file extension values
      are not honored by the new CP framework version. This enhancement streamlines
      allowed file extension configuration.
    - The default valid file extensions list remains the same "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls,jpeg,odt,odm,ods,odp,odf,msg,eml,rtf,ppt,pptx,htm,html,zip,wav,mov,mp4,mp3".

    description: Added default list of valid MIME file types
    details:
    - To improve security, moved FileAttachmentUpload widget attribute valid_file_extensions
      to /customer/development/config/siteConfig.json as CP.ValidFileExtensions.
    - Default valid file extensions are "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls,jpeg,odt,odm,ods,odp,odf,msg,eml,rtf,ppt,pptx,htm,html,zip,wav,mov,mp4,mp3".
    - 'If the CP.ValidFileExtensions configuration settings is not defined in your
      siteConfig.json file, the default sets listed above will be used.To allow a
      restricted set of file types only to be uploaded, define the configuration settings
      with the desired extensions in your siteConfig.json file.For example, if we
      want to allow only "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,doc,xlsx,xls" then define this in the
      siteConfig.json "CP.ValidFileExtensions" : "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,doc,xlsx,xls"'

    description: Added default list of valid file extensions
    details:
    - File upload widgets now ship with a default list of valid file extensions to
      improve out-of-the-box security.  The default list is "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls".  In
      order to allow file extensions other than these to be uploaded, set the valid_file_extensions
      widget attribute to the desired list of valid extensions.

    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.
