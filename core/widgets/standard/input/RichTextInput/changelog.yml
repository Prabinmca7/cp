    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Text size for subject field and question details field were not same
      in case of social question.
    details:
    - This was happening due to Iframe not taking css changes from parent in case
      of question detail field. Now, as per the change, when Iframe gets created,
      that time, it's CSS is set, where fontsize of Iframe matches with subject field
      fontsize.
