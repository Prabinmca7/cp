    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    date: 11/01/2013
    description: Added support for `constraintChange` Dynamic Forms event
    details:
    - Restructured the label area of the widget to support dynamically changing the
      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.

    description: Renders the widget even if the product or category ID does not exist
    details:
    - Previously, when a product or category ID specified either as a URL parameter
      or POST data did not exist, the widget wouldn't render. Now, when an invalid
      product or category ID appears in a URL parameter or POST data, the widget renders
      normally.

    date: 04/29/2013
    description: Enforces required levels when products or categories are defined
      in a URL parameter
    details:
    - Previously, the 'required_lvl' attribute was ignored when the product or category
      was set in a URL parameter (e.g., app/ask/p/123). Incidents were then created
      without the required levels of products or categories.
    - Error messages have been updated. Now when a required level is defined but no
      selection has been made, the error is 'Select a product' or 'Select a category'  instead
      of '{Product or Category} - Select an item.'
    - When a required level is defined and a selection has been made but it does not
      include the required number of levels, the error is '{Product or Category} -
      Please select an item under {selected item}'  instead of '{Product or Category}
      - Select an item.'
