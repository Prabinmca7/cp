    description: Removed error elements on product select
    details:
    - Errors are displayed whenever a serialized product is selected and the serial
      number is not provided or incorrect serial number is provided. Errors are also
      displayed when no product is selected and submit button is clicked. This fix
      involves removing those error elements each time a product is selected.  The
      errors are removed from AssetCheck widget and ProductCatalogInput widget on
      Product select.
