    description: Support Community Self Service permissions and new reference implementation
    details:
    - Removal of `treeview_css` attribute. Use your own css styling rather than incurring
      additional http requests and low-resolution UI icons. See reference implementation
      styling for an example.
    - Renamed elements from Required to Error now that errors based on permissions
      are possible, instead of just errors based on `required_lvl`.
    - The `data_type` attribute was removed.

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: Added support for `constraintChange` Dynamic Forms event
    details:
    - Restructured the label area of the widget to support dynamically changing the
      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.

      opening the top drop-down menu and selecting an option meant that the bottom
      drop-down menu could not be expanded.
