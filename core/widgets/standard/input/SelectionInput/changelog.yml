    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Avoiding double encoding in SelectionInput widget
    details:
    - When creating an Asset from cp, the Asset name is encoded and saved in the db.
      The double encoding was displaying the Asset Name incorrectly in the menu dropdown
      in the AAQ page. This fix involves removing the double encoding from SelectionInput
      widget.

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: When displaying the Incident.StatusWithType.Status field and its
      value changes, the requiredness of the Incident.Threads field will be toggled
    details:
    - Previously on the account/questions/detail page, the Incident.Threads field
      was not set to required, however this field was required if the Incident.StatusWithType.Status
      field was set to 'Yes, please respond to my question'. Now, when a user selects
      that they need an answer to their question the Incident.Threads field will be
      required. If the user selects that they no longer need an answer, the Incident.Threads
      field will be set to not required. It is recommended that you change the default
      of the Incident.Threads field on the account/questions/detail to be required.

    description: Removed call to ClientLoader's getCanUseAria function
    details:
    - The ClientLoader's getCanUseAria function has been removed, so the call to this
      function in the widget has been removed. The standard widget was not actually
      using the result of this function call, so there should be no perceived impact
      of this change.

    description: Added support for `constraintChange` Dynamic Forms event
    details:
    - Restructured the label area of the widget to support dynamically changing the
      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.
