    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Widgets using the ProductCategoryInput needed to be changed
    details:
    - The ProductCategoryInput widget now includes a name attribute instead of a data_type
      attribute. Widgets that contained the ProductCategoryInput needed to be changed
      to consume the new attribute correctly.
