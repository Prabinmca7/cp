      when verifying passwords.

      field is incorrect or different. Previously the wrong input field was indicated

    description: Defaults changed for label\_validation and label\_validation\_incorrect
      attributes to improve messaging in foreign languages
    details:

      ''%s''" (was: "Re-enter %s").'
    - 'The new default value for label\_validation\_incorrect is "Validation for the
      field ''%s'' failed" (was: "%s does not match %s"). Note that there is no longer
      a ''%s'' placeholder for the second field name, which may impact your override
      of the attribute.'

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: The current password field now outputs constraints such as maxlevel
    details:
    - Previously, the current password field, when appearing due to the `require_current_password`
      attribute, did not output validation constraints such as the `maxlength` html
      input attribute. This could result in server-side validation errors if users
      entered password values exceeding the maximum allowable 20 character limit.
      Now constraints such as `maxlength` are included on the current password field.

    description: Added support for `constraintChange` Dynamic Forms event
    details:
    - Restructured the label area of the widget to support dynamically changing the
      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.

    description: Adds the autocomplete attribute to the Current Password field
    details:
    - In the previous version this widget was updated to have the `autocomplete` attribute
      default to `off` on input fields, which disables autocomplete in compliant browsers.
      This change adds the same attribute to the Current Password field, which appears
      in the widget when the `require_current_password` attribute is used. Autocomplete
      is now enabled by default on all input fields in the PasswordInput widget.

    description: Password fields no longer display when field is read-only
    details:
    - When contact password fields on this widget are designated read-only, the field
      does not display. Fields are marked as read-only when the user authenticates
      via PTA/Openlogin or is on the chat launch form.

      To re-enable autocomplete simply add the `disable_password_autocomplete` attribute
      to your rn:widget tag for PasswordInput and set it to false.
