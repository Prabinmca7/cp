    description: Removed error elements on product select
    details:
    - Errors are displayed whenever a serialized product is selected and the serial
      number is not provided or incorrect serial number is provided. Errors are also
      displayed when no product is selected and submit button is clicked. This fix
      involves removing those error elements each time a product is selected.  The
      errors are removed from AssetCheck widget and ProductCatalogInput widget on
      Product select.

    description: Removed references to set_button attribute and remove _setButtonClick
      function
    details:
    - A reference to the `set_button` attribute was included in the widget's logic.js
      file.  As part of routine cleanup, we removed the reference to that attribute
      and the related function (`_setButtonClick`).

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.
