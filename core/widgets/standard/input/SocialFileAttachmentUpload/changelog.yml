    description: Minor Bump in CP attachment widgets for honouring the valid\_file\_extensions
      config verb
    details:
    - The CP file attachment widgets were enhanced to honor the file extensions configured
      in the "VALID\_FILE\_EXTENSIONS" configuration setting. All allowed file extensions
      configured in the siteConfig JSON file must be copied into the "VALID\_FILE\_EXTENSIONS"
      configuration setting. The siteConfig JSON file allowed file extension values
      are not honored by the new CP framework version. This enhancement streamlines
      allowed file extension configuration.
    - The default valid file extensions list remains the same "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls,jpeg,odt,odm,ods,odp,odf,msg,eml,rtf,ppt,pptx,htm,html,zip,wav,mov,mp4,mp3".

    date: 09/01/2022
    description: Added default list of valid MIME file types
    details:
    - To improve security, moved FileAttachmentUpload widget attribute valid_file_extensions
      to /customer/development/config/siteConfig.json as CP.ValidFileExtensions.
    - Default valid file extensions are "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls,jpeg,odt,odm,ods,odp,odf,msg,eml,rtf,ppt,pptx,htm,html,zip,wav,mov,mp4,mp3".
    - 'If the CP.ValidFileExtensions configuration settings is not defined in your
      siteConfig.json file, the default sets listed above will be used.To allow a
      restricted set of file types only to be uploaded, define the configuration settings
      with the desired extensions in your siteConfig.json file.For example, if we
      want to allow only "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,doc,xlsx,xls" then define this in the
      siteConfig.json "CP.ValidFileExtensions" : "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,doc,xlsx,xls"'

    description: Added default list of valid file extensions
    details:
    - File upload widgets now ship with a default list of valid file extensions to
      improve out-of-the-box security.  The default list is "png,jpg,txt,gif,pdf,docx,bmp,doc,csv,xlsx,xls".  In
      order to allow file extensions other than these to be uploaded, set the valid_file_extensions
      widget attribute to the desired list of valid extensions.
