    description: Updated widgets using the rn\_Required screenreader text to use a
      more conformant aria-label style of screen reading.
    details:
    - This widget now utilizes the aria-label view-partial functionality for views
      and .ejs files rather than duplicating logic with the rn\_ScreenReader class.  The
      rn\_ScreenReader class causes issues while using iOS VoiceOver on the mobile
      pageset and should be avoided except in cases where absolutely necessary.

    description: Added read_only attribute to align with TextInput widget
    details:
    - Similar to the functionality in the TextInput widget, a read_only attribute
      was added to allow the widget to render a field's value without allowing it
      to be edited.

    date: 11/13/2014
    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: Added support for `constraintChange` Dynamic Forms event
    details:
    - Restructured the label area of the widget to support dynamically changing the
      required-ness of an input field. This change can impact custom code which overrides
      the `preLabel` or `postLabel` RN Blocks. To consume this change, EJS extension
      will need to be used to override the blocks in their new locations in addition
      to their original locations.

    description: Minimum date validation message changed when DTF_INPUT_DATE_ORDER

    details:
    - The minimum date validation message used to contain the 'Year', 'Month' and
      'Day' labels along with the numeric values when date order was 'yyyy/mm/dd'.
    - The message now simply contains the digits which is consistent with the messaging
      for other date orders.
    - 'Example - OLD -> (min value: ''Year1970/Month1/Day2'') : NEW -> (min value:
      ''1970/1/2'')'

      `$this->data['maxYear']`
