    description: Specify number of descendants to display on ProductCategoryList
    details:
    - Previously, the number of descendant prodcats that would show in the ProductCategoryList
      was equal to the "maximum\_top\_levels" attribute. This was not the original
      intent of the "maximum\_top\_levels" attribute, as its primary function is to
      determine the number of top-level prodcats to show. The number of descendants
      that show is now handled by a new attribute, "maximum\_descendants". This is
      a total of all descendants that will show across all top-level prodcats. Please
      note that when calling the getHierarchy function, the "maximum\_descendants"
      attribute will only be respected if the "levels" attribute is set to 2, since
      that is the only case that descendant prodcats will be shown.

    description: Results no longer incorrectly limited when using the `only_display`
      attribute.
    details:
    - The number of products or categories displayed were being limited by all items,
      and then filtered by items specified in `only_display` so the number of items
      displayed could be smaller than expected.
