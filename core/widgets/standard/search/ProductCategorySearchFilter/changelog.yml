    description: Support new Community Self Service permissions
    details:
    - Products or categories will be automatically filtered from the treeview if the
      user does not have permission to read the product/category or its children.
    - Removal of `treeview_css` attribute. Use your own css styling rather than incurring
      additional http requests and low-resolution UI icons. See reference implementation
      styling for an example.
    - The base.css file was changed.

    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: Multiple pairs of ProductCategorySearchFilters on a page sync correctly
    details:
    - Pages in Customer Portal now support multiple pairs of ProductCategorySearchFilters
      used with the same report ID on a page (e.g. two instances for Product and two
      instances for Category). Since the AdvancedSearchDialog contains ProductCategorySearchFilters,
      this also means that two or more instances of the AdvancedSearchDialog work
      correctly on a page when using the same report ID.

      name
    details:
    - Widgets that extend from this widget will now have both class names included
      in the view. Previously, only the base widget's class name was included in the
      extended view.
