    description: Need to add in a new attribute to override the current page
    details:
    - Previously the DisplaySearchFilters widget would default to the current page
      when a search filter was selected. A new attribute, report\_page\_url, is used
      to redirect the widget when a search filter is selected.

    description: The remove\_icon\_path attribute was removed
    details:
    - The `remove_icon_path` was removed in favor of icons being purely CSS-based.  A
      `show_filter_label` attribute was also introduced in case the label was preferred
      over an icon.  If `show_filter_label` is set to false, the `label_filter_remove`
      attribute will still be used in a screenreader-only span element.

    description: Displays all category search filters specified in a URL, even if
      product linking is enabled and some or all of the categories are not linked
      to the specified product
    details:
    - Previously, category search filters matched only the linked categories specified
      in the URL parameters, omitting those that were not linked.
    - For example, assume that category 456 is linked to product 123, but category
      789 is not. Before this change, requesting answers/list/p/123/c/456,789 displayed
      only the category search filter for 456. But the search produced no results
      since it uses the last category in the chain (789). This was not obvious to
      the end user because the filter for 789 was not displayed.
    - This behavior was changed so that all category filters are displayed, even if
      the categories are not linked to the specified product.
    - This change affects only those sites using product/category linking, and where
      chained categories are specified in URL parameters.

    description: Prevents HTML entities within search filter labels from being double-escaped
    details:
    - Added `_escapeHtml()` to avoid entities from being double-escaped
    - HTML entities within a search filter label are escaped when added to the cache
      via `addFilterToCache()` using `_escapeHtml()`
    - Widgets extending the logic file overloading `_onReportResponse()` should remove
      calls to `Y.Escape.html()`
    - Widgets extending the logic file overloading `addFilterToCache()` should escape
      `filterData` labels with `_escapeHtml()`
