    description: Add `force_page_flip` attribute to prevent AJAX requests
    details:
    - The `force_page_flip` attribute was added so that AJAX requests would not be
      used in cases where a search could result in different widgets rendering on
      the page.
    - Tweak to the submit button to put the label in a span rather than setting the
      value attribute directly on the input element.
