    description: New style of pagination and attributes added, renamed some methods
    details:
    - This change adds new attributes to the widget and a new style of pagination
      which closely resembles the pagination used elsewhere in the product. It also
      updates the HTML used for pagination.
    - The most important new attribute is numbered\_pagination, which when set to
      true, enables the new style of pagination for the widget. This value is false
      by default. There are also some new 'label'-type attributes related to the new
      pagination.
    - Some internal methods, which may impact child widgets, have been renamed for
      consistency.
