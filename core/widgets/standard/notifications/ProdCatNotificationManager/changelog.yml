    description: Widgets using the ProductCategoryInput needed to be changed
    details:
    - The ProductCategoryInput widget now includes a name attribute instead of a data_type
      attribute. Widgets that contained the ProductCategoryInput needed to be changed
      to consume the new attribute correctly.

    date: 11/13/2014
    description: Corrected behavior when label_input is empty
    details:
    - If the label\_input attribute is empty, the required asterisk will also not
      display. The empty value will be output since some widgets, notably the ProductCategoryInput
      widget, expect the input label to be displayed and causes a JavaScript error
      when it cannot be found.  While providing a useful label\_input value is necessary
      for providing good accessibility to screen readers, rather than forcing the
      label\_input attribute to be required, this change instead causes the empty
      element to be output.  This small change in the view of the widget requires
      the minor bump of the widget.

    description: Fixes the renew event handler and removes unnecessary product chain
    details:
    - The ProdCatNotificationManager handled the renew and delete events incorrectly
      when multiple notifications were in use. This change fixes that bug while also
      removing the unnecessary product and category chains from the URLs generated
      by the widget. It is unlikely that custom widgets extending from this widget
      will be impacted. If a custom widget needs the product or category chains in
      the URL, they can be manually constructed in a custom controller extension.
