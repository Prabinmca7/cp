    description: Changes the AnswerNotificationManager widget to use Event Delegation
    details:
    - The AnswerNotificationManager did not correctly handle the renew or delete events
      when multiple notifications were in use. This change refactors the widget to
      handle events correctly, but in doing so causes significant changes to the widget's
      interface.
    - If you have custom widgets that are extended from this widget, you will need
      to upgrade them before consuming the new version.
    - Additionally, this fixes the bug that causes the widget to display the incorrect
      notifications after renewing a notification subscription.
