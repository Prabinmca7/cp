    description: Updated CSS to work with YUI 3.13 and refactored CSS and JS to comply
      to standards
    details:
    - With the upgrade to YUI 3.13, a new CSS rule was added to ensure results are
      properly displayed. In addition, all CSS rules have been prefixed with the rn_Polling
      rule to ensure they don't apply to other elements on the page. Finally, the
      logic.js file was slightly refactored to use YUI node instances instead of native
      DOM objects wherever possible.
