    description: Initial Version
    details:
    - This new widget displays a code that can be given to an agent. Agent can use
      the code to start a screen-sharing session with the end user from an incident
      workspace. This widget is different than its predecessor, CoBrowseLink widget,
      in that it allows for faster connections when using the instant mode to see
      the customer portal pages, but can also be configured to operate in an advanced
      mode for desktop sharing. Agent will also have the ability to escalate from
      instant to an advanced mode. To consume this widget make sure that Cobrowse
      Premium is provisioned for the site and interface.
    - It is recommended that this widget be included on all customer portal pages
      or at a minimum on all pages that the agent needs viewing for instant mode to
      work correctly.
    - As a final note, the CoBrowseLink widget is deprecated and will be removed in
      a future version of Customer Portal.
