    description: Legend tag was replaced with H2 tag to fix accessibility issue.
    details:
    - '''legend'' tag was replaced with ''h2'' tag (for the label\_header attribute)
      in the ''view'' file and the whole body was enclosed in a ''div'' tag instead
      of a ''fieldset'' tag with a CSS border around it. This was changed to add accessibility
      support to the label\_header label.'
