    description: Remove invalid widget attributes
    details:
    - This change removes the `always_show_hint`, `hide_hint` and `initial_focus_on_first_field`
      attributes from the widget. These attributes were inherited from the parent
      widget and were unused by this widget. This change has minimal impact and will
      only affect custom code which extends from this widget and uses one of these
      attribute values for some purpose. If this is the case, the impact can be mitigated
      by declaring the attribute in the custom widget's info.yml file.
