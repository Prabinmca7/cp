    description: Prevents products and categories without end user visibility from
      being displayed
    details:
    - Previously, the widget would incorrectly display products and categories that
      should not be visible to end users. It no longer displays those values.
    - Additionally, when the `report_page_url` attribute is in use, the links now
      use a single Product or Category value for the URL instead of a full chain.
      This aligns with other URLs in the product.
    - If you extend this widget, you can no longer rely on the chain value to appear
      in the `$this->data['value']` array.
    - Instead, you must modify your URLs to use the single ID.
