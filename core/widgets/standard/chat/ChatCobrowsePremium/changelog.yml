    details:
    - This widget lets a customer respond to Cobrowse premium invitation requests
      from an agent. If the customer accepts the request, this widget will start a
      screen sharing session with the agent. Unlike its predecessor, ChatCoBrowseButton
      widget, this widget allows for faster connections in instant mode that enables
      sharing of the Customer Portal pages only, but can also operate in an advanced
      mode for desktop sharing. Agent will also have the ability to escalate to an
      advanced mode. To consume this widget make sure that Cobrowse Premium is provisioned
      for the site and interface
    - It is recommended that the ChatCobrowsePremium widget be included only on the
      chat_landing page
    - It is recommended that the CobrowsePremium widget be included on all customer
      portal pages or at a minimum on all pages that the agent needs viewing for instant
      mode to work correctly
    - As a final note, the ChatCoBrowseButton widget is deprecated and will be removed
      in a future version of Customer Portal
