    description: Request URL to widget server should not contain dynamic parameters
    details:
    - With this fix, dynamic parameters like  rn\_contextData, rn\_contextToken, rn\_formToken,
      rn\_timestamp, w\_id will be removed from the widget server request URL to make
      it cacheable. This will help in reducing load on web servers during high load
      times.

    description: Route Conditional Chat Link Ajax requests via the widget server to
      reduce load
    details:
    - The ConditionalChatLink widget can be enabled to poll every 5 seconds to determine
      if Chat is available. By default, this widget polls. There is a risk the web
      server will succumb to high loads when polling is enabled and an unusually high
      number of visitors view the CP pages. These changes route the AJAX requests
      via the widget server (Squid).  Squid caches responses, reducing the load to
      the web servers by a huge margin. Failure to upgrade to this version may cause
      downtime under high loads.
