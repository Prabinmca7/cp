    description: Disables the Print button during a chat for specific browsers
    details:
    - 'Some browsers (e.g., Safari and Chrome) do not allow printing until the last
      GETUPDATE request returns. To prevent end users from trying to print during
      the chat session, the Print button is selectively disabled for those browsers
      and a message tells the user: ''You will be able to print after the chat has
      ended.'' The Print button is re-enabled at the end of the chat session.'
