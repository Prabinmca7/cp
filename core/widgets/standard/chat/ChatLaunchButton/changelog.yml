    description: Incorporate the new Form `collect` event for Dynamic Forms Enablement
    details:
    - As part of the new Dynamic Forms Enablement API improvements, the Form module
      has been changed to fire a new `collect` event prior to a form submission to
      gather only the visible fields from the Form. Any widgets which extend from
      this widget and alter the form submission behavior should replace their previous
      `submit` event usages with the new `collect` event.
