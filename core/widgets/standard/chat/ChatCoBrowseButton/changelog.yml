    description: Support for Cobrowse Premium so that it does not display the 'End
      Screen Share' button when using Premium
    details:
    - You can only use one of ChatCoBrowseButton or ChatCobrowsePremium widgets on
      the chat_landing page. The changes made in this version make sure that the 'End
      Screen Share' button does not display when using Premium. The ChatCoBrowseButton
      widget is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of the Customer
      Portal. It is recommended to use the ChatCobrowsePremium widget going forward.
